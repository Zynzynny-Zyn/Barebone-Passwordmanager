# Barebone-Passwordmanager
It's just a barebone password manager. Nothing special for now. 
All this is just a password manager made in python with capabilities of generating,storing,showing and deleting passwords.


## Steps to use the Password manager

1 Run the Table creator(To create the table necessary to manage the password)


2 Open the password manage.py(To use the program

## Dependencies

1 This program requires a terminal to run. A program like Python IDLE is recomended but any terminal could do.

2 This program runs on python3 so intsallation of python 3 is required in order for this program to work

## Disclaimer

This program's table is formated badly moreover this is in no way an alternative to a regular password manager. Though It could be used as a password managr. It should be noted that this is not secure in any way. The Database will be stored locally so security will depened on the user. 

## Disclaimer for contributers

For those intrested in contributing to this project. I will only be allowing contributions in the Python language. It recomended to have a basic insight on sqlite3. 

## Note

I am open to criticism though that dosen't mean insult me as a person but I hope I improve. Remember this is in no way this will be
an alternative to other password manager. This Is not encrypted in any way all! Also I am only open to contributions in Python  not because I think it is better than all other languages but because it is the language im most comfortable with.
